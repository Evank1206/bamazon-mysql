INSTRUCTION

1. Create a MySQL Database called bamazon.

2. Then create a Table inside of that database called products.
    item_id (unique id for each product)

    product_name (Name of product)

    department_name

    price (cost to customer)

    stock_quantity (how much of the product is available in stores)

3. Populate this database with around 10 different products. (i.e. Insert "mock" data rows into this database and table).
4. The app should then prompt users with two messages.

The first should ask them the ID of the product they would like to buy.
The second message should ask how many units of the product they would like to buy.
